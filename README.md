Dental radiographic images, particularly X-rays, are essential tools for diagnosing, planning treatments, and monitoring dental health. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on the expertise of dental professionals, which can be affected by human limitations such as fatigue, experience level, and inter-examiner variability. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning have shown significant promise in medical imaging, enabling automated, accurate, and efficient disease detection.

This study presents an advanced Dental Disease Detection System that leverages the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm to identify and localize various dental pathologies, including caries, periodontal diseases, periapical lesions, and impacted teeth. The system integrates image preprocessing techniques, jaw segmentation algorithms, and deep learning-based object detection to enhance diagnostic accuracy. By training YOLO on an annotated dataset of dental X-rays, the model achieves high sensitivity and specificity in detecting dental anomalies. Additionally, a Gradio-based user interface is developed to allow dental professionals to upload and analyze radiographs conveniently.

The proposed system aims to enhance accessibility, efficiency, consistency, and early detection in dental diagnostics, especially in areas with limited access to specialists. It also serves as an educational tool for dental students and practitioners by highlighting pathological features within X-ray images. This paper details the system's development, including the theoretical background, implementation methodologies, evaluation results, and potential future improvements. Ultimately, the system is designed to augment the diagnostic capabilities of dental professionals, providing a valuable AI-assisted tool to improve patient outcomes.
